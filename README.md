🧠 Word Drip

Word Drip is a fast-paced, tile-based word game that tests your vocabulary under pressure. Start with a grid of letters and race against the clock as new letters drop every few seconds. Can you build enough valid words before time runs out or the board fills up?

🎮 How to Play
	1.	You start with 7 random letters – at least 2 vowels guaranteed
	2.	After you submit your first valid word, the game begins
	3.	A new letter is added to the board every 10 seconds
	4.	You can only use letters currently visible on the board
	5.	Each letter tile can only be used once per word (unless duplicates exist)
	6.	The game ends when:
	•	You reach 15 valid words
	•	You fill 3 full rows (21 letters)
	•	Or the 3-minute timer expires
